**Please note**: If you are new to Prefect, we strongly recommend starting with [Prefect 2](https://docs.prefect.io/) and [Prefect Cloud 2](https://app.prefect.cloud), as they are in [General Availability](https://www.prefect.io/guide/blog/the-global-coordination-plane/).

Prefect 1 Core, Server, and Cloud are our first-generation workflow and orchestration tools. You can continue to use them and we'll continue to support them while migrating users to Prefect 2.

If you're ready to start migrating your workflows to [Prefect 2](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect), see our [migration guide](https://docs.prefect.io/migration-guide/).

# Prefect Server

Please note: this repo is for Prefect Server development. If you want to run Prefect Server, the best first step is to install [Prefect](https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect) and run `prefect server start`.

If you want to install Prefect Server on Kubernetes, take a look at the [Server Helm Chart](./helm/prefect-server).

If you would like to work on the Prefect UI or open a UI-specific issue, please visit [the Prefect UI repository](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/ui).

## Overview

[Prefect Server](https://docs.prefect.io/orchestration/server/overview.html) is an open source backend that makes it easy to monitor and execute your Prefect flows.

Prefect Server consists of a number of related services including:

- `postgres`: the database persistence layer
- `hasura`: a GraphQL API for Postgres (http://hasura.io)
- `graphql`: a Python-based GraphQL server that exposes mutations (actions) representing Prefect Server's logic
- `apollo`: an Apollo Server that serves as the main user interaction endpoint, and stitches together the `hasura` and `graphql` APIs
- `towel`: a variety of utility services that provide maintenance routines, because a towel is just about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can carry
  - `scheduler`: a service that searches for flows that need scheduling and creates new flow runs
  - `lazarus`: a service that detects when flow runs ended abnormally and should be restarted
  - `zombie_killer`: a service that detects when task runs ended abnormally and should be failed

These services are intended to be run within [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and some CLI commands require [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) which helps orchestrate running multiple Docker containers simultaneously.

## Installation

1. Don't Panic.

1. Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and Prefect installed:

   ```
   pip install prefect
   ```

1. Clone this repo, then install Prefect Server and its dependencies by running:

   ```
   pip install -e .
   cd services/apollo && npm install
   ```

*Note: if installing for local development, it is important to install using the -e flag with `[dev]` extras: `pip install -e ".[dev]"`*

## Running the system as a developer

*Note: for [deploying Prefect Server](https://docs.prefect.io/orchestration/server/overview.html#deploying-prefect-server), please use the `prefect server start` CLI command in Prefect Core 0.13.0+.*

If you are doing local development on Prefect Server, it is best to run most services as local processes.
This allows for hot-reloading as code changes, setting debugging breakpoints, and generally speeds up the
pace of iteration.

In order to run the system:

1. Start the database and Hasura in Docker:

   ```bash
   prefect-server dev infrastructure
   ```

   _If when starting the infrastructure, you receive an error message stating_ `infrastructure_hasura_1 exited with code 137`, _it is likely a memory issue with Docker. Bumping Docker Memory to 8GB should solve this._

1. Run the database migrations and apply Hasura metadata:

   ```bash
   prefect-server database upgrade
   ```

1. In a new terminal, start the services locally:

   ```bash
   prefect-server dev services
   ```

You can use the `-i` (include) or `-e` (exclude) flags to choose specific services:

```bash
# run only apollo and graphql
prefect-server dev services -i apollo,graphql

# run all except graphql
prefect-server dev services -e graphql
```

## Running tests

Prefect Server has three types of tests:

- `unit tests`: used to validate individual functions
- `service tests`: used to verify functionality throughout Prefect Server
- `integration tests`: used to verify functionality between Prefect Core and Server

Prefect Server uses `pytest` for testing. Tests are organized in a way that generally mimics the `src` directory. For example, in order to run all unit tests
for the API and the GraphQL server, run:

```bash
pytest tests/api tests/graphql
```

Unit tests can be run with only `prefect-server dev infrastructure` running. Service and
integration tests require Prefect Server's services to be running as well.
